          <h1>How we met</h1>
          <p class="text reveal">
            Our love story began in the most unexpected way with a sarcastic
            WhatsApp message. We were both on a group chat which he created for
            scholars going to the same school through the PTDF scholarship. I
            was preparing to travel to Malaysia for a master’s degree, and he
            was also preparing to travel for his PhD in Malaysia. I reached out
            to him the first-time regarding visa application details, and let’s
            just say his sarcastic reply got me pissed.<br /><br />
            Few weeks later, I had issues uploading my passport photo on the
            visa application portal due to size constraints, so I decided to
            reach out to him the second time because he had already completed
            this phase. He helped me resize multiple times until it eventually
            went through, I appreciated his effort and my perception about him
            changed (positively). We did not communicate again until when we met
            in Malaysia in February 2022.<br /><br />
            My housemate (now my close friend) happened to be his friend as
            well, so he visited us frequently. Overtime, we became a clique of 4
            friends, myself, Rashida, Fatima and my fiancé (who was just a
            friend then). He invited me to church one day, and we started going
            to church together. This made us become close friends. He is very
            smart and was always ready to help me figure out my coursework or
            research in school.<br /><br />
            Few months down the line, he expressed his feelings and said he
            wanted us to be together, but I just wanted us to be friends, so we
            stayed friends. He didn’t give up and was very patient despite my
            stance. I concluded my masters in May 2023 and was prepared to
            return to Nigeria; he became worried about the uncertainty of us
            meeting again. I eventually returned to Nigeria and though miles
            apart, we kept in touch and even played games like scrabble
            online…lol. When he visited Nigeria in December 2023, he asked me to
            be his girlfriend and this time, I said yes. Life has been so
            beautiful with him, and I know he’s God’s gift to me.<br /><br />
            In May 2025, he proposed and here we are now. He’s a man that’s so
            thoughtful, loving, caring and intentional. I love him so much and I
            pray that God keeps us together forever in love, Amen.

              Over the past years, you have proved over and over again that our
              love stands at the centre of all. You have mesmerised me with
              care, kindness and support. Maybe, you were the one i was crying
              to see at birth (laughs). Your actions and inactions brought us to
              this wonderful day we celebrate. I am overwhelmed with a love i
              never knew existed. As we begin our forever journey, All roads
              leads to you! I promise to be your best friend, your confidant,
              and your biggest supporter. I promise to cherish you, to love you
              unconditionally, and to always make your happiness a priority. I
              promise to laugh with you, to cry with you, and to face every
              challenge life throws our way, hand in hand. We will build a home
              filled with warmth, laughter, and endless love. I will always be
              your safe harbor, your Chief, your King and the one who will
              always believe in you, even when you doubt yourself. We will raise
              wonderful children, and our love will last till eternity.
